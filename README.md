# R Programming
An almagamation of useful codes and practices I learned from R-Programming course offered by the Johns Hopkins University through Coursera, the second course of the data science specialization. This does not cover the entire materials from the course, but only a handful of sections I believe can be practical, especially for "playing" with raw data and conducting initial data analysis.
